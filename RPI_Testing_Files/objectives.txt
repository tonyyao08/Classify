What are the things we want to be able to accomplish with the RPI?
-how are we going to run an interface on the RPI? How are we going to do it so that once we connect
the power cord, it just displays the intended GUI? How are we going to format the file to do that?
	-ideas on how to do this: https://medium.com/@avik.das/writing-gui-applications-on-the-raspberry-pi-without-a-desktop-environment-8f8f840d9867


-how to take picture using camera
-how to upload those images to AWS (what bucket are we using, is it provided by UMD, etc.)
-will python even run on the RPI, how do we even get python running on the RPI in the first place
-we need to create a WebApp using AWS Kinesis: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/building-a-raspberry-pi-telepresence-robot-using-serverless-part-1/


-RPI to AWS to WebApp
-WebApp talks to AWS about training and testing/classifying
-just need a video stream going from RPI to AWS IOT/Kinesis (tutorial that Nick posted above)



-RPI sends camera to AWS IOT and


-make sure tony's code works for taking a photo, then send photos of coins to AWS team
-if video streaming can be done wired, look into it

-write code in python to tell RPI when to take the photo: use opencv
-vivado3 SDK to interface with S3


NEW OBJECTIVES:
-detect image and take a picture of it (aal)
-see how to upload images to S3 bucket (Sanjay)


last week objectives: (for 4/17 onwards)
-we need code to recognize if there is a coin and then take a picture (Sanjay)
	-


-see how we can create flask app on raspberry pi to accept commands from 
webapp to run the code

^^helps set up video feed on RPI

SAMPLE COMMANDS:
Take picture: raspistill -o test.jpg
^^takes test.jpg image and stores in current directory after 5 seconds


Start video stream:
raspivid -o - -t 0 -w 800 -h 600 -fps 12  | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8080/}' :demux=h264
-o is our output, in this case set to none.
-t is the length of the video clip, using zero will set this to infinite.
-w and -h are the width and height of the video, in this case 800 x 600.
-fps are the frames per second for the video stream, a lower value should minimize dropouts.
| cvlc is a pipe which takes the output from the raspivid command, our video stream and streams the video using an h264 codec via real time streaming protocol (rtsp) over our network.


Now, on PC/Mac:
open up VLC player, enter URL: rtsp://10.0.0.54:8080/
-stream now starts working with a 5 second delay

FINAL PROJECT DELIVERABLE
        (Each entry below is 0-X scale of disagree to agree that your deliverables 
	 persuade me on the given criteria. To illustrate, a system might technically 
	 be buildable, but if your delivery doesn't show evidence of it as such, or 
	 if I can't build/install it, then I have no basis to agree with an assertion 
	 about "buildable."  Obviously, this rubric heavily rewards products that are
	 evidencing successful use in hands of product owners and customers.)

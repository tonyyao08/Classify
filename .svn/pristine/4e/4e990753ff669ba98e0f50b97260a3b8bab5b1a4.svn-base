This rubric is based on the assumption that we came to strong agreement on the shape
and objectives of the project by means of the product definition exercise (aka the
"green light") or perhaps by that spec as amended by comments in the grading at that
time. It was the necessary starting point for us to practice building according to 
plans in a process-centered development environment. If planning was effective, then 
our implementation should have been straight forward. In any case, in this rubric we
assess how well the sprint proceeded. Later, the final delivery's grade will be based 
in part on my assessment of how well the project captures the spirit of the original 
assignment, which is to say, how well we actually solved the problem.


CONSISTENCY     __ /15		"Does it do what we said?"
scale:		System can't be demonstrated, is unrelated to the spec or project has no spec.
		System demonstrated exhibits substantial discrepancies from spec or can't tell.
		System demonstrated exhibits minor (understandable) discrepancies.
		System demonstrated seems consistent with the spec.


FUNCTIONALITY
  Score:	__ /40		"Does it do what we meant? (Does it solve the problem?)"
  Scale:	0. I see nothing work
		1. I see a few components work separately, though with serious defects or system
		   failures, and with others missing.
		2. I see likely components work in pieces even if not together, though with
		   serious defects or system failures.
		3. I see a rough system function partially, though with defects or system failures.
		4. I see a system doing something even if we can't tell how related to problem.
		5. I see a system appear to address articulable parts of the spec, even if with
		   rough edges.
		6. I see a system address major parts of the problem (per spec), even if not all
		   of it.
		7. I see a system demonstrate problem solutions per spec, though with brittle
		   edge cases.
		8. I see a system smoothly demonstrate credible activity related to the problem
		   though not fully populated with data at scale.
	       *9. I see a usable system credibly solve problems per spec using realistic data
		   though not fully at scale or in target environment.
		10. I see a usable product that is ready for acceptance testing.


IMPLEMENTATION  __ /35		"Does it reflect professional practices?"
properties:	Configurations are actively managed and capture essential dependencies w/o bloat.
		Components support traceability to tests and spec.
		Reasonable code standards were employed and followed.
		Record evidences sustained development; the team was fully engaged and employed
			sound practices that improved quality based on experiences with system use.
		Implementation decisions make effective use of resources and are efficient
			as appropriate to project.
		Implementation meets reasonable standards for security, privacy, accessibilty,
			usability and intellectual integrity (above and beyond requirements made
			explicitly in the spec.)
		Code exhibits strong cohesion with low coupling between design units; dependencies
			are actively managed; code base can be maintained.

PRESENTATION    __ /10
scale: 		The team offered no presentation.
		In the team presentation I heard/saw ...
		... an ad hoc pitch that lacked organization and credibility.
		... a basic message though with need of polish (to timing,
			consistency, expression or similar)
		... a businesslike pitch/demo offered with professionalism and polish

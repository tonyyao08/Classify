Ask Prof. if we can ask him to install dependencies so we don’t need to do everything through VM?


Install dependencies on VM - Done in ImageAI Dir
Documentation has example code in Python3, pre installed on VM 


First Step: Test Image Classification Accuracy


METHOD 1: Run predictions using pre built models (easy and fast)


Link below shows how we can perform a single image prediction and there are 4 pre-built models to try out (check if allowed?)

METHOD 2: Run predictions using custom models (hard and slow)
… may take hours to train and it’s recommended we have 500 or more images for each object we want to train, 1000 is optimal amount)


Link below gives detailed example on how we can train our own custom models

Idea for generating more images: augment dataset
Ex. 
Take the original image of a coin, turn it into 25 slightly different images by rotating the coin by some x degrees. 
Repeat for the image of the back of the coin. 
This will allow us to take 50 different images of one coin, and then we just need 10-20 different images per coin. 
(Can add other methods of augmentation?)
Second Step: Try built-in Object Detection Training
Pretty much the whole parts classifier problem can be solved by training our model to detect objects in images or a video.


METHOD 1: Train for object detection on images

METHOD 2: Train for object detection on videos
